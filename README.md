# Osquo's Extensions
A fun-focused and (hopefully) balanced extension to the vanilla game, aiming to open up new playstyles!
This is my first mod (and first real project like this), so I hope you're able to enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.

# Content
- 55 New Jokers
- 3 New Spectral Cards

- 1 Pair of Vouchers (2 Total)
